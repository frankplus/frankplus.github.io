This is a port of the game to the web using webassembly and emscripten to compile the code. 
I have rewritten the game engine to support webGL/opengles 3.

## Features
- Working rendering engine compatible with opengles3
- Sprite renderer using shaders
- keyboard support
- Working sound engine using SDL_mixer
- Mouse support to control the player
- Gamepad support
- Online connection through websockets
- Keyboard support for text typing
